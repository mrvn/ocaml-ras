ocaml-ras
=========

OCaml-Ras is an extension library for the OCaml language, providing
functions to calculate redundancy blocks from blocks of data
and to restore the data given enough data or redundancy blocks.
Redundancy is calculated in a finite field of size 2^16 allowing
for up to 65536 data + redundancy blocks.
